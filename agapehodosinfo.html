                    <p>We often go out and do tabling. This is basically where we just set up a table and either ask peope a questions
                        about God, or answer their questions. We usually do this with Bones, which is just a way to share the gospel.

            <h2>What We Believe</h2>

            <p>I believe in one God,</p>
            <p>the Father almighty,</p>
            <p>maker of heaven and earth,</p>
            <p>of all things visible and invisible.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
            <p>the Only Begotten Son of God,</p>
            <p>born of the Father before all ages.</p>
            <p>God from God, Light from Light,</p>
            <p>true God from true God,</p>
            <p>begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father;</p>
            <p>through him all things were made.</p>
            <p>For us men and for our salvation</p>
            <p>he came down from heaven,</p>
            <p>and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,</p>
            <p>and became man.</p>
            <p>For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,</p>
            <p>he suffered death and was buried,</p>
            <p>and rose again on the third day</p>
            <p>in accordance with the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>He ascended into heaven</p>
            <p>and is seated at the right hand of the Father.</p>
            <p>He will come again in glory</p>
            <p>to judge the living and the dead</p>
            <p>and his kingdom will have no end.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,</p>
            <p>who proceeds from the Father and the Son,</p>
            <p>who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,</p>
            <p>who has spoken through the prophets.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.</p>
            <p>I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins</p>
            <p>and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead</p>
            <p>and the life of the world to come.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Amen.</p>
